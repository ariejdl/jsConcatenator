ruby script to combine .js files, similar to the 'compass watch' command

use as follows:

1) In your webapp create a /js directory, leave it blank
2) Create a /js-build (or other named) directory
3) Only use the /js-build directory for javascript files during development
4) to refer to a dependency in a javascript file use:
   4.1) //=require "one"
   	this refers to /js-build/one.js
   4.2) //=require "dir/_one"
   	this refers to /js-build/dir/_one.js
5) the contens of the referenced files will be added in order
6) running the command
   > ruby jsConcatenator -w
   from within the /js-build directory, where the script should reside
   will start looking for changes, to this directory
7) the script will mirror the directory structure found in /js-build in /js, 
   ignoring files beginning with an _ (underscore)


example:

project/
	js-build/
		_one.js
		_two.js
		nested/
			_three.js
		main.js // contains references to all three
	js/
		main.js // contains all file references

TODO
	need to reimplement minification
	catch problems using the same name twice
	decide on approach to infinite loops since doesn't ensure a DAG
